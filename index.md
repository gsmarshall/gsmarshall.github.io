# Sam Marshall - Open Source GIS
My name is Sam Marshall and I'm a junior at Middlebury College majoring in computer science and geography. I am passionate about using GIS to fight climate change and make the world a more equitable place to live, and I am interested in topics related to spatial analysis, remote sensing, image processing, and computer vision.

This website contains my work for [GEOG 323 - Open Source GIScience](https://gis4dev.github.io/), as well as a small collection of other projects related to spatial analysis, cartography, and GIS. You can view my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/gsmarshall).
