# Sam Marshall - Open Source GIS
My name is Sam Marshall and I'm a junior at Middlebury College majoring in computer science and geography. I am passionate about using GIS to fight climate change and make the world a more equitable place to live, and I am interested in topics related to spatial analysis, remote sensing, image processing, and computer vision.

This website contains my work for [GEOG 323 - Open Source GIScience](https://gis4dev.github.io/), as well as a small collection of other projects related to spatial analysis, cartography, and GIS. You can view my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/gsmarshall).


## GIS Analyses

Lab assignments focus on reproducing and replicating GIS research, as well as creating GIS tools for use by future classes and the general public.
- [Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction in QGIS](gravity/gravity.md)
- [Rosgen Classification of Natural Rivers](rosgen/HEGSRR-Replication-Report.md)
- [Urban Resilience in Dar es Salaam with PostGIS](dsm_resilence/dsm_resilience_report.md)


## Blog Posts

Blog posts contain my thoughts and reflections on GIS methodology and ethics, critical GIS scholarship, and GIS as an open science.
