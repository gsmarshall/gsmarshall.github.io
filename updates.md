Potential updates/upgrades:

- Add link to GG351/Remote Sensing project
- Add page for personal cartography work, with a bit of writing about it
  - Maybe restructure page so that the home page is more of a general portfolio page and then links to a specific OpenSource page
- Add land acknowledgement/data disclaimer (talk to Jacob?)
- Add profile picture to github page
