Potential updates/upgrades:

- Add link to GG351/Remote Sensing project
- Add page for personal cartography work, with a bit of writing about it
  - Maybe restructure page so that the home page is more of a general portfolio page and then links to a specific OpenSource page
- Add land acknowledgement/data disclaimer (talk to Jacob?)
  - link to other cartographers/cool people doing cool geography stuff
- Add profile picture to github page
- Add a 'mission statement' of sorts? Basically explain what motivates my academic interests, what excites me, why I am approaching GIS and CS the way I am, why I think that's valuable, etc
  - in short: I love the combination of algorithmic problem solving with the power/influence, responsibility, and beauty of geospatial analysis and problem solving. I am interested in writing code, developing software, and all the low-level intricacies of data storage, representation, and processing that come with that; but I feel compelled to direct that energy towards projects/work that have the capacity to improve the world and that can accomodate a connection to place for the producer (i.e. me) and the user. My connection to place is an important part of my identity and motivates my decisions in school (what projects I work on, etc) and out of school (working for RMC), and GIS related work feels like one of the only niches of software development that doesn't get disembodied from the idea of place by the incentive to make everything in the internet age universal. To be clear, I am not trying to say that I want all the GIS work I do to be related to places I have a connection to or that I expect GIS tools to be coded with particular places in mind. I am only saying that I feel that GIS related work - be it anything from software development to GIS consulting/analysis to cartography - allows for my sense of place to motivate my work in a way that other aspects/subdisciplines of CS don't, and that is something that is very valuable to me.
