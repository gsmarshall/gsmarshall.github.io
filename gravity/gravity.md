title: Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction in QGIS
---

## Purpose

<p>This collection of QGIS models implements a gravity model of spatial interaction. The models are implemented around a case study of hospital service regions in the northeastern United States but could be applied to any number of similar spatial interaction processes.</p>

<p>The core gravity model is adapted from that described in [The Geography of Transport Systems](https://transportgeography.org/contents/methods/spatial-interactions-gravity-model/) (Rodrigue). It accepts as input two sets of vector features, one representing the source features and the other representing the target features, and produces as output a single vector layer representing the likely zone of influence that each target feature occupies. The potential for interaction between any pair of source and target features is calculated based on user-specified weight fields for the source and target features and the distance between the two features.
